        data-description="Functionality: Print Text in Digital Style: It uses a typingPrint function that simulates slow typing to improve user interaction.

        Credential Management: It has an authentication system for an admin panel, allowing only users with the right credentials to access the program's advanced settings.
        
        Monument List: The program contains a predefined list of monuments, each of which has a name and associated link. Users can select a monument to generate the corresponding QR code.
        
        Color Settings: Users can choose from different colors for the text and QR code. The colors are predefined, and the user can iterate through the available options.
        
        QR Code Generation: Uses the qrcode library to actually generate QR codes based on the link of the selected monument. QR codes are saved as PNG files and opened for viewing.
        
        Feedback and Interaction: The program provides feedback to the user, such as success or error messages, to ensure a good user experience."

        data-title="Custom CMD" 
        data-description="Program Description: 
        The program acts as a custom command line interface (CLI), similar to the Windows Command Prompt (cmd), but enriched with specific features to make interaction more user-friendly and useful. Users can invoke different commands to perform various operations. Here's a brief summary of the available features through the commands:
        
        !new: Allows for the creation of a new file and renaming it. This feature helps users quickly start working on files without navigating through a graphical interface.
        
        !file: Allows opening a user-specified file. It requires entering the file's directory to open, which makes the function useful for viewing existing documents.
        
        !ip: Displays the clientâ€™s IP address. This command provides useful information about the current network connection of the user.
        
        !feedback: Allows users to leave feedback about the program. This is useful for receiving suggestions and improvements from users.
        
        !ai: Designed to use artificial intelligence in the cmd, even though the program is currently not implemented correctly. It could be an area to improve in the future.
        
        !weather: Shows the weather for a specified city. This feature allows users to check weather conditions without using a browser.
        
        !calculator: Provides a calculator for performing various types of calculations. It helps users perform mathematical operations directly from the CLI.
        
        !time: Allows getting the current local time. This function is useful for users who need time information during command line usage."

        data-title="Password Generator" 
        data-description="Welcome Interface: At startup, the program shows a welcome message in ASCII art and waits for 3 seconds before clearing the screen. User Data Request: The user enters the password length. If the input is 0 or invalid, the program requests input again. Then it asks how many numbers and how many letters to include,
        ensuring that the sum exactly matches the length. Input Check: If the requirements are not met, the program shows an error and requests data to be re-entered. Password Generation: Once the data is verified, the program generates random letters and numbers based on the user's specifications.
        Password Shuffling: The preliminary password is randomly shuffled to avoid a predictable order.
        Generation Simulation: Before displaying the password, the program simulates a wait.
        Password Display: Finally, the program shows the generated password."

        This Python script uses the python-telegram-bot library to create a Telegram bot. When a user sends the /start command, the bot responds with a welcome message and an inline keyboard with various buttons. 
        The buttons allow users to access private information, links to social media, and a shop. The bot handles callback events 
        to respond to user inputs via buttons, sends messages and photos, and manages the deletion of previous messages to keep the conversation clean."

        accompanied by another inline keyboard offering further options, such as direct links to start immediately or request support. The bot also handles 
        the back action to delete previously sent messages, maintaining an organized conversation."
